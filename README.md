## Note

Files have been split into 25MB parts with the _split_ command. For instance:

```console
$ split -b 25M -d SLI_OMSTI_ILI_CoNLL_1.0.7z SLI_OMSTI_ILI_CoNLL_1.0.7z.part
```

To rejoin these parts, you can use the _cat_ command. For instance:

```console
$ cat SLI_OMSTI_ILI_CoNLL_1.0.7z.part* > SLI_OMSTI_ILI_CoNLL_1.0.7z
```
